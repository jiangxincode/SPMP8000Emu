## Areas That Need Help

- **Game compatibility testing** — test more games and report issues with screenshots
- **HLE API implementation** — some system API calls are not yet fully implemented
- **ARM CPU emulation** — improve instruction accuracy for edge cases
- **Platform ports** — macOS, Linux, Android, and iOS testing and packaging
- **Documentation** — improve docs and code comments
- **Bug reports** — if you find a game that doesn't work correctly, please open an issue
- **RetroArch integration** — compatibility testing across frontends
